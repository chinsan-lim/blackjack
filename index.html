                <h2>how to play</h2>
                <p>In this adaptation of the classic game to 21, we will be using an 8 card deck.</p>
                <h4>Rules from <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/">Bicycle Cards</a></h4>
                <p>START</p> 
                <p>Disregard first hand and place your bet!</p>
                <p>OBJECT OF THE GAME <br>
                Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
                </p>

                <p>CARD VALUES/SCORING<br>
                    It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.
                </p>

                <p>BETTING<br>
                Before the deal begins, each player places a bet, in chips, in front of them in the designated area. Minimum and maximum
                limits are established on the betting, and the general limits are from $2 to $500.
                </p>

                <p>PLAYER <br>
                The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for
                another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two
                cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand
                on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses and the
                dealer collects the bet wagered. 
                <br>
                The combination of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a "soft hand," because the player can count the
                ace as a 1 or 11, and either draw cards or not. For example with a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), the total is 7 or 17.
                While a count of 17 is a good hand, the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a bust hand by
                counting the ace as an 11, the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by standing or "hitting"
                (asking the dealer for additional cards, one at a time).
                </p>

                <p>
                THE DEALER'S PLAY <br>
                After you stand, the dealers face-down card is turned up (in our case, click on the blue card back to reveal the dealer's bottom card) If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic
                on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.
